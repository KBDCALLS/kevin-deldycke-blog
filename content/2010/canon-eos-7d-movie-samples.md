Here is a collection of Eiffel Tower's videos I took today with my [Canon EOS 7D](https://amzn.com/B002NEGTTW/?tag=kevideld-20). These quick and dirty clips were shots this late afternoon.



Please don't look at the image quality. That's not the point. We're interested in bitstream, video/audio codecs and media container here.

These files are as they came out of the camera and can serve as references. The idea is to provide raw data access to developpers and hackers to let them add or [enhance 7D's support](https://www.kdenlive.org/video-editor/canon-eos-7d) to their software.

Here are seven 10 seconds video clips, corresponding to the 7 video modes offered by the 7D (that's a lot of 7's):

Resolution | Framerate | Shutter Speed

[1920x1080](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/1080p-29.97fps.mov) (1080p) | [29.97 fps](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/1080p-29.97fps.mov) (30 fps) | 1/60
[1280x720](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/720p-50fps.mov) (720p) | [50 fps](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/720p-50fps.mov) | 1/100
[1280x720](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/720p-59.94fps.mov) (720p) | [59.94 fps](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/720p-59.94fps.mov) (60 fps) | 1/125
[640x480](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/480p-50fps.mov) (480p) | [50 fps](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/480p-50fps.mov) | 1/100
[640x480](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/480p-59.94fps.mov) (480p) | [59.94 fps](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/canon-eos-7d-movie-samples/480p-59.94fps.mov) (60 fps) | 1/125

Again, these files were extracted right out of the camera, without any modification.

Even if these details have no importance, here are some parameters under which these clips were shots (may be useful for debugging):
