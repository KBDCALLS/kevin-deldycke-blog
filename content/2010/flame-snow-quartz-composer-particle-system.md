After creating a [series of compositions](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2010/11/sharp-scan-lines-squared-lava-lamp/) based on my [kaleidoscopic patch](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2010/10/kaleidoscope-001-002/), I played with Quartz Composer's particle system, to create a flame and falling snow flakes:

As for the last times, both [Flame]({attach}flame.qtz) and [Snow]({attach}snow.qtz) source compositions are available. Flame's patch looks like this:
