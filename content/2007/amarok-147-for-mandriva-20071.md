![Amarok 1.4.7 for Mandriva 2007.1](/uploads/2007/amarok-147-logo.png)

Iâ€™ve just backported [Amarok 1.4.7](https://amarok.kde.org/en/node/243) from
cooker to Mandriva 2007.1 (aka "Spring" edition).

Packages are
[downloadable from my RPM repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs)
for `i586` and `x86_64` architecture and both build support SQLite, MySQL and
Postgresql as database backend.
