The [8th version of my e107 to Wordpress import script](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/) is out! This version is quite special because this is the first one that support all features I planned to implement in [the road map I write for the first alpha release]({filename}/2006/e107-to-wordpress-importer-alpha-version.md).

Here is the changelog:

  * Import images embedded in e107 news and custom pages,

  * Import e107 site preferences (like site name and description),

  * Better import of user profile data,

  * An existing user on the blog can be detected and updated automatically,

  * Fix the [profanity filter bug](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/11/wordpress-to-e107-v06-better-content-rendering-and-extended-news-support/#comment-2499),

  * Tested with latest [Wordpress 2.1.3](https://wordpress.org/development/2007/04/wordpress-213-and-2010/).
