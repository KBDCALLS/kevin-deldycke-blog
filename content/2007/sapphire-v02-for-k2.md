I've just release a new version of
[my Sapphire adaptation for K2 theme](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2007/03/sapphire-style-for-k2-wordpress-theme/).
This second release not only fix margins regarding the main layout, but also
styles of blockquotes and lists (to render them consistently in comments).

Here is a
