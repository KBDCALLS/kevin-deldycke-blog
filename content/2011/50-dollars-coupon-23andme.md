Today I've just received [
another](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2008/12/give-away-of-the-day-free-23andme-100-vouchers/)
[23andMe](https://www.23andme.com) coupon by email. This time it's only valid
for a short period of time (until August 9, 2011), but there is no restriction
on how many people can use it.

Here is a screenshot of the mail with the coupon code (`8WR9U9`):

Feel free to use the coupon as many times as you need!
