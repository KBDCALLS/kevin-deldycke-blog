Here is a collection of articles I wrote during the past year. Together they form a guide that will let you setup a full-featured Debian server. All of these tutorials are based on the recent work I did to setup my personal server on Debian Squeeze.

These articles are independent with each other, meaning you can pick the one your interested in to customize your server and ignore the others.

  1. Setup [SMART]({filename}/2011/setting-hdds-smart-monitoring-debian-squeeze.md) monitoring tool for HDDs.

  2. Setup [Nut]({filename}/2011/mge-ellipse-750-ups-debian-squeeze.md) to manage the UPS.

  3. Setup [Duplicity and Amazon S3]({filename}/2011/cloud-based-server-backups-duplicity-amazon-s3.md) for cloud-based backups.

  4. Setup [Exim]({filename}/2011/how-to-gmail-send-mails-debian-squeeze.md) to relay mails via Gmail.

  5. Setup [cron-apt]({filename}/2011/fresh-debian-thanks-to-cron-apt.md) to keep our distribution up to date.

  6. Add a [fail2ban]({filename}/2011/configuring-fail2ban-debian-squeeze.md) deamon.

  7. Setup [Munin]({filename}/2011/munin-monitor-debian-squeeze-server.md) to monitor our machine.

  8. [Basic setup of Nginx + PHP-FPM + MySQL]({filename}/2011/nginx-php-fpm-mysql-debian-squeeze-server.md) web stack.

  9. [Optimizing Nginx + PHP-FPM + MySQL]({filename}/2011/nginx-php-fpm-mysql-configuration.md) for performances.

  10. Setup [PHP APC]({filename}/2011/php-apc-debian-squeeze-munin-monitoring.md) op-code cache.

  11. Install [haveged]({filename}/2011/entropy-debian-squeeze-server.md) to get lots of entropy.

  12. Setup a [WebDAVs]({filename}/2011/lighttpd-powered-webdavs-server-debian-squeeze.md) server with Lighttpd.

  13. Setup [Mailman + Nginx + Exim]({filename}/2011/setup-mailman-nginx-exim-debian-squeeze.md) for mailing-lists.

  14. Mailman [mailing-list migration]({filename}/2011/mailman-migration.md) and [merging]({filename}/2011/how-to-merge-mailman-mailing-lists.md).
