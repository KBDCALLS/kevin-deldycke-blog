Here is the ultimate version of Amarok! The [version 1.4.4 of Amarok was
released today](https://web.archive.org/web/20070212221847/https://amarok.kde.org/content/view/84/66/),
and I've added it to [my brand new Mandriva 2007
repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs). As a bonus, this RPM
support three database system to store audio collections: SQLite (default),
MySQL and Postgresql.

I've noticed that MusicBrainz features are broken in the default Amarok 1.4.3
which come with Mandriva 2007. Unfortunately, those features are still broken
in this release. Sorry.
