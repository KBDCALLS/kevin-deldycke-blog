I've compiled a new RPM of [Diva](https://www.diva-project.org) for Mandriva 2007. This RPM is the cutting-edge version of Diva based on the latest SVN revision of the project (r315). You can [find it in my repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs).

Diva is based on gstreamer, so please install all `gstreamer0.10-*` RPMs first. Because this version is still an alpha _and_ a developper version, it is subject of numerous bugs and instability. So please, don't report me bugs, I'm not a Diva developper!
