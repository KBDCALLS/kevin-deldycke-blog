I backported [TOR, an onion routing system to communicate anonymously on the Internet](https://tor.eff.org) from cooker to Mandriva 2006.0. You can [find it in my repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs).

As usual, to [install packages from my repository, take a look at my previous posts](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/04/new-repository-for-mandriva-2006/).
