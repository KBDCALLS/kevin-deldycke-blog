I updated my [Linux Scripts page](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts) and added some old dummy scripts: [process-monitoring.py](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts/blob/master/process-monitoring.py), [monthly-internet-uptime.py](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts/blob/master/monthly-internet-uptime.py), [adsl-monitoring.py](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts/blob/master/adsl-monitoring.py), [crop-tiff-images.py](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts/blob/master/crop-tiff-images.py), [xwd2png.py](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts/blob/master/xwd2png.py) and [osdir-slideshow.py](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts/blob/master/osdir-slideshow.py). Basically they are just shell command with a little bit of python around.

Take a look at my [Linux Scripts page](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts) to get a short description of each.
