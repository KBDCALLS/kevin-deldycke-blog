It's finally time to announce the availability of [all my dotfiles on GitHub
](https://github.com/kdeldycke/dotfiles). I've started the project 2 months ago
and now things are stable enough to publish this blog post.

It's an hybrid repository which support both OS X and Kubuntu. This collection
of configuration files are mainly aimed at Python developers working in vim.
All color schemes are based on [Solarized
](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and most, if not all, command lines
produces colored output.
