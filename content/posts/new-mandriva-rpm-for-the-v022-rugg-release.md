title: New Mandriva RPM for the v0.2.2 Rugg release
tags: Linux, Mandriva, RPM, rugg

A [new version of Rugg was released two weeks ago](https://groups.google.fr/group/rugg/browse_thread/thread/c213eb23d2ba8981/afe7da6486a731fe). So I did a [new RPM for Mandriva 2006](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs/tree/master/2006.0/Rugg-0.2.2-1).

I discovered this new release when [I informed the Rugg project of the existence of my RPMs](https://groups.google.fr/group/rugg/browse_thread/thread/9bac73f7594264b2/690e44b2ab54a864). SÃ©bastien Pierre, the author of Rugg, was pleased to receive my little work, so [he added me to the contibutor list](https://rugg.sourceforge.net/support.html). This is the best reward I could expect! :)
