[Amarok 1.4.3 is out](http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/81/66/)! Here are the
[brand new packages for Mandriva
2006](http://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs). This version of Amarok is a
backport from the cooker repository and is built to work with KDE 3.4.2 (which
is the default version that came with the free download edition of Mandriva
2006). I've also added in my repository all the missing depencies:
[TunePimp](http://musicbrainz.org/products/tunepimp/index.html) 0.4.2,
[`libmtp`](http://libmtp.sourceforge.net) and `libofa0`.

As requested by some peoples in my [previous
release](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/08/amarok-142-final-for-mandriva-2006/),
the MySQL support was missing. I've just added it for this 1.4.3 version.
Please leave a comment to let me know if it work (or not), because I don't use
this feature myself.

As usual, take a look at [previous release post and comments about
Amarok]({tag}amarok) if you experienced problems. There you will be able to get
some tips.
