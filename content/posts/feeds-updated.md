Last night I've changed the way my feeds are handled on this blog. I've taken care of all redirections with a mix of [WordPress plugins](http://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/answer.py?answer=78483), [Apache's 301 redirects](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2007/05/feedburner-and-e107-integration/) and [Feedburner's "My Brand" service](http://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/answer.py?answer=79590). So everything should be transparent from your (and your feed reader) point of you.

But since this [blog moved](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2009/09/moving-wordpress-blog-to-another-domain/) from one location to another in the last past years, I doubt everyone use the right URLs. This update is a good opportunity to check that you are using the "official" feed URLs:

  * For blog posts: [http://kevin.deldycke.com/feed](http://kevin.deldycke.com/feed)

  * For blog 
In the future, I plan to support these URLs only. So please update your feed aggregation settings! :)
