Inspired by a [Hacker News
comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13260149), and to perfectly
complement the curated list of [*Awesome Falsehoods Programmers Believe
in*](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) I maintain on the side,
here is a glorious list of meta falsehoods:

1. Everything said in every falsehoods list is true.
1. There exists a falsehoods list that is entirely true.
1. Every falsehood that is true should be accounted for.
1. Every falsehood that is true CAN be accounted for.
1. Making your code compatible with a falsehood doesn't come with a price.
1. There are no falsehoods which are mutually exclusive.
1. Falsehood lists are written by programmers with expertise in other matters.
