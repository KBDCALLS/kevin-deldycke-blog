Inspired by a [Hacker News
comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13260149), and to perfectly
complement the curated list of [*Awesome Falsehoods Programmers Believe
in*](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) I maintain on the side,
here is a glorious list of meta falsehoods:

## Falsehoods

1. Falsehoods are true.
2. Falsehoods are false.

 * Writing falsehoods lists make you an expert.
 * Writer of falsehood lists are [immune to their edicted
falsehoods](https://twitter.com/benjiweber/status/785422755843956736).
