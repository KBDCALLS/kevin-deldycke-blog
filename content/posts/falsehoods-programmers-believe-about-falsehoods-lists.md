Inspired by a [Hacker News
comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13260149), and to perfectly
complement the curated list of [*Awesome Falsehoods Programmers Believe
in*](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) I maintain on the side,
here is a glorious list of meta falsehoods:

1. Falsehoods are true.
1. There exists a falsehoods list that is entirely true.
1. Falsehood lists are complete.
1. Falsehoods do not change with time.
1. There's only one way to express a falsehood.
1. There are no falsehoods which are mutually exclusive.
1. Every falsehood that is true should be accounted for.
1. Every falsehood that is true can be accounted for.
1. Making your code compatible with a falsehood doesn't come with a price.
1. Falsehood lists are written by programmers.
1. Falsehood lists are written by people with expertise in the matter.
1. Reading falsehoods lists make you a better programmer.
