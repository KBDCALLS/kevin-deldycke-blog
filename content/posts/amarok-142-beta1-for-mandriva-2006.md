The [first beta of amarok 1.4.2](https://community.kde.org/Amarok/Archives/Release:1.4.2_Beta1)
was out for about 2 weeks and today I backported it to Mandriva 2006. This new
version is the first to include the [Advanced Tag Features (ATF)
system](https://web.archive.org/web/20090214035957/http://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php/ATF)
which is perfect for people with big and constantly evolving music collection.

[Here are the RPMs](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs), and here [the
explanation to use
them](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/04/new-repository-for-mandriva-2006/).

If you have some issue with this release, take a look at [comments of previous
versions](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/07/amarok-141-for-mandriva-2006/) and
my "[You installed Amarok from my RPMs and canâ€™t play some files? Here is the
fix...](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/08/you-installed-amarok-from-my-rpms-and-you-cant-play-some-files-here-is-the-fix/)"
post.
