Hi all!

I've created a RPM repository on this site to deposit third-party software I found all around the net. At that time, available packages are [Wormux](https://www.wormux.org) v0.7 and [Baghira](https://baghira.sourceforge.net) v0.7.

To add the repository to your urpmi database, in a terminal, do as root:

    ```shell-session
    $ urpmi.addmedia kev-repository https://kevin.deldycke.com/static/repository/mandriva/2006.0/i586 with hdlist.cz
    ```
