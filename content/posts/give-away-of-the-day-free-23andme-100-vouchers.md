I ordered a [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com) v1 kit (_[Time's invention of
the year 2008](https://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854493,00.html)_)
in early march. The [version 2 of the "personal genetic
kit"](https://www.23andme.com/en-int/howitworks/) was [released some months
ago](https://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/23andme-cuts-it.html).

As a late v1 customer, they offered me a free v2 upgrade. Even if I had to pay
the shipping ($70 as european), that's really fair as it accounts for $399.
They also gave me two $100 coupons. So if you do the maths, they offered me the
difference between the price I paid for the v1 ($999) and the actual value of
the v2 kit ($399). That's an honest commercial act! :)

Alas, the coupons **expires December 31 2008**, and I don't plan to take
advantages of the discount. So I'll give them away to the firsts of you who
send me a mail or post a comment.
