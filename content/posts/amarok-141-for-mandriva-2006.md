Today I've successfully backported the last stable version of Amarok from
cooker to Mandriva 2006. You can find the [Amarok 1.4.1 RPM packages in my
repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs).

Beside Amarok, you'll find there other packages like [libvisual
](https://web.archive.org/web/20061029133304/https://localhost.nl/~synap/libvisual/)
v0.4, [libgpod](https://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod.html) v0.3.2 which are required
by this latest release of Amarok to work properly.

To [install packages from my repository, take a look at my previous
posts](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/04/new-repository-for-mandriva-2006/).
