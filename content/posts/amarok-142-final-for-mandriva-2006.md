[Amarok 1.4.2 final is
out](https://community.kde.org/Amarok/Archives/Release:1.4.2) and here are [my
RPMs for Mandriva 2006](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs). To install
them, I advise you to add my repository to your local urpmi database.

If you experience some problems with this package, take a look at [comments on
the 1.4.1
release](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/07/amarok-141-for-mandriva-2006/) and
my ["You installed Amarok from my RPMs and can’t play some files? Here is the
fix…"](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/08/you-installed-amarok-from-my-rpms-and-you-cant-play-some-files-here-is-the-fix/)
post.
