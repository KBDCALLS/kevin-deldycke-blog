I've just backported [qemu](https://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/) 0.9 to
Mandriva 2007. This release include the
[kqemu 1.3.0pre11 kernel module, which was released under the GPL some weeks ago](https://lwn.net/Articles/220807/).

As usual, this package is
[available in my RPM repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs).
