I've changed my backup strategy today, so I updated my [`website-backup.py` script](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts/blob/master/website-backup.py). You can find the latest version of the script on [my script page](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts).

I now use [rdiff-backup](https://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/) in this script to keep 32 days of incremental backups. Beside this the script do a monthly full archive of the website in bzip2 format. This new strategy has reduced the total size of my backups from 64 GB to 6.7 GB. Roughly 90% of free space gain thanks to rdiff-backup! If rdiff-backup is so efficient in my case, this is due to the existence on my websites of large files that are rarely modified (Mp3s, Flacs, RPMs, images, etc...).
