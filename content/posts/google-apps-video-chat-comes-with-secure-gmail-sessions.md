The story was spread by [all](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2008/11/gmail_now_with_voice_chat_and_video.html) [top](https://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_launches_video_and_voic.php) [tech](https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081111-gmail-gains-voice-and-video-chat-via-mac-and-pc-plug-in.html) [blogs](https://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/11/google-adds-voice-and-video-chat-to-gmail/) last week: [Google's Gmail now features a video chat](https://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html). And it requires the installation of a dedicated plugin.

Alas, there is no such plugin for any other platform except "_Windows XP and later_" ([according the official website](https://mail.google.com/videochat)) and Macs ([as read on the official blog](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/talk-face-to-face-right-from-within.html)). So it's a quite sad news for us Linux users. Indeed, I'm confident about a future seamless integration into the free software ecosystem, as the Gmail's video chat is [based on a stack](https://juberti.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html) of open ([or soon-to-be, according the recent controversy](https://blog.senko.net/2008/11/12/gmail-videochat-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/)) standards and protocols: [XMPP](https://xmpp.org)/[Jingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle_(protocol)), [h264/SVC](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Video_Coding) & [RTP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol).

Anyways, that's not the main purpose of this post.

I just wanted to point out an update that was not reported by the news: as soon as it was officially made available for the public, the brand new [video feature was released for Google Apps' Gmail](https://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/2008/11/browser-based-voice-and-video-chat.html) too.

Not only that, Google also backported to Apps' Gmail the [much awaited HTTPs option](https://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/08/gmail-https-doe.html#comment-127126868) that allow you to force secure encryption of your sessions:

These two updates are quite interesting to note. I long as I remember (and I might be wrong), Google Apps components were always out-of-sync with their legacy equivalent. So this maybe a sign of change in a really good direction for Google Apps users! :)
