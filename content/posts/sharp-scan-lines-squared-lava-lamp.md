Here are 2 new Quartz Composer compositions. Both of them are based on the same [kaleidoscope patch](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2010/10/kaleidoscope-001-002/) from my last post, but are processed before the final rendering. This gives some interesting visual effects that are quite distant to the original kaleidoscopes.

As usual, [sources of this _Sharp scan-lines_ composition](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/sharp-scan-lines.qtz) are provided. And for information, its patch looks like this:

Again, you can [download the _Squared lava-lamp_ source](https://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/squared-lava-lamp.qtz), and here is preview of its patch:
