I've upgraded
[my old QLC RPM](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2008/05/qlc-2-6-1-for-mandriva-2008-1/)
to [the 3.0.0 version](https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=930755).
This release is built for Mandriva 2009.1 and x86_64 architecture only, and do
not depends on LLA. I also had to remove the FTDI output plugin as it doesn't
compile on my machine. You can find the
[QLC RPM in my repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mandriva-specs).

In the end, this RPM is quite a prototype. I didn't checked that it works well
beyond the UI (check the screenshot for a proof). So use it at your own risks!
