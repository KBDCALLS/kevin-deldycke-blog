In April '06, I've decided to no longer use [Nuxeo's CPS](https://www.cps-project.org) and start a new online adventure with this blog.

Last week [I've moved the majority of my stuff](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/10/old-site-to-blog-merge-in-progress/) (articles and scripts mainly) from [my objectis.org web site](https://kevin.objectis.net). There, I've compiled a list of linux commands I don't want to forget, in the spirit of ["Directory of Linux commands"](https://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/) from O'Reilly and [pixelbeat.org Command Line Tips](https://www.pixelbeat.org/cmdline.html).

I've reordered all of the commands by theme and I'll now publish each theme as a unique post, one theme per week, under the "_\[Theme Name\] commands_" title. This week: [File Management commands](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2006/10/file-management-commands/).
