Here is my
[latest version (0.4) of Sapphire](https://github.com/kdeldycke/sapphire/archive/sapphire-0.4.zip)
for K2. This version fix the style to let it work with the
[Release Candidate 3 of K2](https://web.archive.org/web/20140704105644/https://getk2.com/2007/10/k2-release-candidate-3-released/).

It also include some CSS backports from K2 v0.9.6, especially the CSS trick that
automaticcaly resize your big images to fit the weight of the  central theme
column.
