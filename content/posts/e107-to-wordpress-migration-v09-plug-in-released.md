[9 months after the last one](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2007/05/e107-to-wordpress-v08-import-images-and-preferences/), here is the [new version (v0.9) of my e107 to Wordpress import plug-in](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/)!

Change log:

  * "One-click migration" instead of multiple step process (more user-friendly),

  * Better error management (a must-have for precise bug reports),

  * Replace all links to old content with permalinks (increased SEO),

  * Better database management,

  * Work with latest [Wordpress v2.3.2](https://wordpress.org/development/2007/12/wordpress-232/) and [e107 v0.7.11](https://e107.org/news.php?item.824),

  * Code cleaned up! ;)
