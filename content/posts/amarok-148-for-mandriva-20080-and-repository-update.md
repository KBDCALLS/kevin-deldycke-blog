I've just rebuild [Amarok 1.4.8](https://amarok.kde.org/fastforward_148) for
Mandriva 2008.0 with MySQL and PostgreSQL support.

This was also an opportunity for me to rebuild old packages ([Interreta
Televidilo](https://web.archive.org/web/20111019071359/https://televidilo.bouil.org/),
[Rugg](https://rugg.sourceforge.net) and
[`python-icalendar`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar/3.11.1)) for
Mandriva 2008.0. For now there is no `x86_64` version of the packages
(including Amarok). I plan to do it later.

Update: Amarok was recompiled to include latest
[`libgpod`](https://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod.html) version (0.6.0).
