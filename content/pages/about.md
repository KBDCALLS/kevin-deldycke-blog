My name is **Kevin Deldycke**, I'm a Data Engineer living in Paris, France.

---------

I'm working at [Scaleway](https://scaleway.com), a cloud platform delivering
on-demand bare-metal compute instances, and all the associated services.

I'm designing and implementing data-crunching pipelines to manage the
operationnal and business aspects of the infrastructure.

This involves working daily with [Python]({tag}python) (my language of choice
since 2003), [Pandas]({tag}pandas), [Cassandra]({tag}cassandra), Spark,
[PostgreSQL]({tag}postgresql) and the likes.

---------

Before joining [Scaleway](https://scaleway.com), I spent several years writing
and shipping business software in various industries such as banking, retail,
consulting, energy, transport and government agencies.

I graduated with a Master’s in Software and Industrial Engineering from
[*École Centrale de Lille*'s IG2I
department](https://www.ec-lille.fr/en/degree/ig2l-en.html).

## Resume

If my appalling attempts to impress with the babbling above did not worked, you
may be thrilled by the following soporific information on my professional
background:

Format | Language
---|---
PDF | [English](https://docs.google.com/a/deldycke.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1XaJgwRAhxHDuBSD-JqE--8WKGx0uTasa6IOU4IFBeKg) ● [French](https://docs.google.com/a/deldycke.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1JYITJ3JU9WYvQXWlpGqLO9LzhcfAxiqJSsV8WyVhyyY)

Resumes, CVs and profiles above are heavy on irrelevant details. And that's
absolutely intentional. I designed these to form an extensive *professional
activities database*. Not as resume _per se_. So feel free to pick there
data you need to fill in your talent database and please ignore the rest.


## About this site

This place is an evolving notebook where I deposit tiny pieces of knowledge
(*knowledgelets*?) I generate in my personal and professional activities.

Everything's in English as a way to practice, and to make my knowledge
available to the largest audience. It's not my mother tongue and you’ll surely
find mistakes. If you do, please be kind enough to comment on the blog (or
better, [send a
pull-request](https://github.com/kdeldycke/kevin-deldycke-blog/pulls)) so I can
quickly fix errors. I sometimes write [in French]({category}francais) to target
a French-speaking audience.

This blog was previously titled *coolkevmen*. This is the nickname under which
I appear in the credits of the [All Cool
Hits](https://coolcavemen.com/disc/all-cool-hits/) album, by my friends the
[Cool Cavemen](https://coolcavemen.com).
